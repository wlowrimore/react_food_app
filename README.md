# DelishMeals
## A ReactJS Food Ordering Application...

This application is part of the Udemy ReactJS course.  It features the use of the hooks: useState, useEffect, useReducer, and useContext.  It also utilizes 'props drilling' where use of Context is not neccessary; along with many important JavaScript functions such as: .map, .filter, setTimeout, and so on. While inside of the "Your Cart" modal, the user can add and remove items which adjusts both, the item quantity and the total price. From there the user can then open their cart and select the 'Order' option.  Once the 'Order' option is selected, an order form will appear prompting the user to enter their name and address.  This application is set up with a firebase back-end so that the order information will be saved in the firebase database.  However, if the user chooses to cancel, rather than order, there is a button for that, as well.  Once the cancel button is clicked, the order is erased and the modal closes. Each component has it's own module.css file, when needed, providing a pleasant and clean UI.
